# Auralin Viewport Addon

## Overview
Auralin Viewport is a World of Warcraft addon designed to enhance the gaming experience by providing customizable viewport settings. It allows players to adjust the rendering area of the game world, offering a personalized interface setup.

## Features
- **Viewport Adjustment**: Easily modify the top, bottom, left, and right viewport margins.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive menu for adjusting viewport settings.
- **In-Game Configuration**: Change settings on-the-fly without the need for logging out. Reloading the UI is required due to memory instability that happens when the World Frame changes. When changes are saved the UI reloads automatically.

## Installation
1. Download the addon.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file into the `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` directory.
3. Ensure that the addon is enabled in the game's addon menu.

## Usage
- Use the slash command `/avp` to open the configuration menu.
- Adjust the sliders to change the viewport margins.
